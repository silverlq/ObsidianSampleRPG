### Hindrances
#### Flashbacks
Makai was traumatized after witnessing the slaughter of the RRR MC, and from time to time has flashbacks of the time he saw his dying father and brother. *If triggered, roll a Spirit (–2) roll. On a fail, he is distracted and gets 1 level of Fatigue, which can be removed by a few minutes of peace and quiet.*

### Edges
#### Chromed
2 IP
#### Steady Hands
Firing from the back of a horse or moving vehicle is tricky business, but your adventurer has figured it out. She ignores the Unstable Platform penalty (see page 109). This also helps when running, reducing the usual penalty from −2 to −1 (see Movement, page 92).
#### Nerves of steel
Your hero has learned to fight on through the most intense pain. He may ignore 1 point of Wound penalties.
