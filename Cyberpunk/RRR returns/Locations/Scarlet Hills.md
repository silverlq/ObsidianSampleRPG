A settlement made from the wreckage of trains, trucks and concrete walls, set against the sandy slopes of Scarlet Peak. The local leader is Red-fist [[Gwendolin]], a fierce ex-member of the [[Red Road Riders]]. This location is known for the Scarlet Hills Rally, an explosive and dangerous race through a canyon where the winner gets to sit at the settlement's council and take part in executive decisions.
