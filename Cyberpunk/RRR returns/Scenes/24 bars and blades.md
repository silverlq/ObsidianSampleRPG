They gathered a few things from the dead guards. Makai picked up an assault rifle and and Joshua an SMG. The lady donned the protective vest of one of the guards she had shot, then grabbed an access token from his belt. She raced towards a door and said "This way".

They walked through a metal corridor with many holding cells. Most of them were empty and one of them was open, they could see the signs of struggle inside, dried blood and scratches on the floor and around the walls. That is where the lady had escaped from. There were no guards here in this corridor, and two of the cells were occupied.

The tall lady used the dead guard's access token to unlock one of the doors. "Mizu!" exclaimed a young girl inside the cell, as he ran towards the woman and hugged her. She was also wearing a hospital gown. "You alright Yurei? They didn't hurt you did they?" Mizu responded, stroking her sisters hair.

"Hey! Let me out! You there!" a voice screamed from down the corridor. There was a young corpo in the last cell with a bruised face and wearing a battered suit. Makai walked towards it. "Don't let him out. He is one of them" Mizu said. "No! Listen, I work for [[Optacon]], Sentricus's competitor. They put me here after they found that I was a corporate spy! Please!" he pleaded.

"I don't think he is lying" said Makai, he walked towards the cell and said: "I'll let you out if you tell us what you know about this operation. Do you know who [[Komarov]] is?". The man's eyes widened: "Komarov? No, listen you don't want to mess around with these people. They are dangerous. Please, let's run away before they kill us all!".

"Makai!" Joshua suddenly exclaimed, looking down towards his wrist cyber interface "we are in trouble, they know we are here". At that moment they heard a door opening behind them. A strange creature stood there, it was a slender robot, tall and hunched, with blades emerging from inside its arms. "Intruders, drop your weapons" it said with a cold, raspy voice.

Before any of them could think a canister was ejected from the robot's chest, flying down the corridor towards the group and a high pressure gas started to eject from within it. A nauseating smell overwhelmed them, their eyes burned and pooled with water. Then their throats started to flare with pain. Joshua and Yurei fell on their knees coffing.

"Masks!" Makai shouted, as he whipped his backpack around and put one of the gas masks he had brought. Then, he helped Joshua put on another one. [[Ashton Varif]] quickly put on his mask then threw a grenade at the robot. "Bingo!" he said, as his grenade rolled on the floor and landed right between the robot's legs as it exploded. With a loud blast, the robot had been obliterated.

Mizu and her sister both put on the two spare masks that Makai had in his backpack. Joshua and Yurei were still coughing, but they could stand and walk. "Makai, there are more of them coming" Joshua said in between coughs. "This way" Mizu said, leading them down the cell-block corridor into the north exit, away from the chemical storage area they had seen.
