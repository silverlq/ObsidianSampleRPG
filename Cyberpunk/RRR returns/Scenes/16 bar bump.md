Makai and Joshua were able to bribe a bartender at [[Sharp's bar]], who told them [[Tago Niagara]] was a regular there and that he would likely show up for a drink that Friday at night. So the two of them went back there on Friday and sat at a table in a corner, and ordered some Zywiec beer. 

The place was dimly lit by neon red lamps, some industrial grind house music screeched, and they could smell the dirty nearby bathroom behind them.

At 7 PM, Tago showed up with another man, and then 2 more joined them shortly after. Makai recognized them as members of the [[Mad Wolf]] gang. The two men that arrived after did not sit down, as soon as they greeted the others, they looked towards Makai's direction and started to walk towards him.

"Nice bar hey? I'd be a shame if we left it all bloody and broken" one of the men said. "We were just having a drink in peace" said Joshua, then he looked at Makai and continued "but now we are ready to leave". So him and Makai stood up and started walking towards the door.

As soon as they crossed the wolves, they were attacked. Makai saw it coming and turned around to block in time, but Joshua took a bottle to the head and fell over a table. Makai was prepared for this and quickly pulled out his tazer, then shoved it under his attacker's arm, who fell limp to the floor. Then, Makai swiftly tazed the man who hit Joshua, pressing the tazer against his neck.

"Joshua, are you alright?" Makai asked. "Yeah, I'm good" Joshua replied stroking the back of his head. "They're leaving! " he pointed towards Tago and his companion, who were bolting towards the exit of the bar.

Makai and Joshua raced after them, and saw them getting into a car outside, so they got into theirs a and started chasing them on the road.
