Two days later, at the end of the day [[Elvira Yara]] walked into the [[Vagabond]] bar followed by her bodyguard. [[Joshua]] came to greet her, then brought her to a table at a dark corner where [[Makai]] was sitting. "So we meet in person finally, what a nice evening, isn't it?" she said as she sat down.

"I wonder what fine gentlemen like yourselves would need from a lady like me. Are you looking to open an account?" she said with a smile. "Not today" replied Joshua as he handed Yara a nice cocktail with a cherry and then sat next to Makai. "We need your help to track where this money came from" he continued as he pulled the jumpdrive out of his pocket.

Yara looked perplexed yet intrigued. She picked up the jump-drive and looked at it. "You know what, you boys are quite interesting characters so I will indulge you. I feel like I am in a movie" she chuckled. Yara pulled her laptop out of her purse, plugged in the drive and started analyzing it. 

"You, know these things were supposed to be untraceable. But nothing nowadays is really untraceable is it?" she said as she typed away in her keyboard. Then she stopped, her expression changed to that of content and she said: "Now, if I were to find what you were looking for, you would be so kind as to repay the favour wouldn't you?" she glanced at Makai with a cheeky half-smile. "We certainly would. What could we offer you miss Yara?" said Makai.

"See, I happen to have a jump-drive of my own at home. That one is loaded with a daemon. It would greatly please me if that jump-drive found it's way  into the computer of a certain auditor Jianjun, at the 30th floor of the government building near Eastern Sky plaza" she said squinting her eyes, then she took a sip of the cocktail.

Joshua looked at Makai and nodded. "We are in" said Makai. She seemed pleased. She finished her drink, then looked at her screen and said: "Tago Niagara, a former employee of [[Tekonika]], a weapon parts manufacturer subsidiary of [[Sentricus]]. That is the man you are looking for".
