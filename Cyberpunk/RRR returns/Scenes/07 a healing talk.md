Makai received a wire transfer from Yara for his payment on the day after he returned the laptop, and he used a good portion of the money to send [[Catori]] to a health care facility so that her illness could be treated. Makai's mother [[Enoli]] was elated about her daughter getting treatment, and she herself helped to treat Makai's leg injuries at home. 

After a week had passed since car crash he felt much better, although his legs were still not fully healed. It was a Saturday morning and the doorbell rang on the Spark residence. [[Tyson]] had come to talk to Makai.

"Good morning" Tyson said as he walked inside. "Tyson, it is always nice to see you, welcome" said Makai. "It seems you have used that old truck of mine for a noble cause. I heard Catori is getting help now" Tyson said with a smile. "She is, mother is with her right now. It is a really nice place" Makai answered.

"Joshua has told me about your encounter with the wolves." Tyson said with a serious expression, then continued: "I had a suspicion they were starting something again. But what you did was too hasty. They are now turning their eyes towards us. They saw you and they know you were triple-R".

"Yeah, I know" said Makai. "Listen, our priority is to keep [[Jenova]] safe. We probably need to hire more guns now that the wolves are coming back. Since you started this, now I will task you with getting the MC members back together" said Tyson.

"You are right Tyson, we can't do anything to the wolves without bringing back triple-R. But for some reason I don't feel like I am the one who will be able to convince them to come back" said Makai. "You are young, brave, and you are [[Atohi]]'s son so you are more likely to bring them back than anyone else around here, certainly better than an old fart like me. Start by talking to Red-fist [[Gwendolin]], she has many followers and if she joins our cause others will also come".
