When the wolves had arrived at [[Jenova]] and Tyson messaged Makai, he also messaged Joshua about it. Joshua took the opportunity to investigate the wolves den, since he knew most of them would have been out in the raid.

Joshua arrived at the location Makai described. He looked around the exterior but could not see anyone. He used a hack token to unlock the door, which opened without an issue. At that moment one of the mad wolves who was on guard and had seen Joshua coming snuck up behind him with a knife, but Joshua heard him at the last second and turned around as they got into a close quarters fight.

Joshua dodged the attacker and punched him in the face. The wolf came back and slashed Joshua's arm with the knife, but then Joshua grabbed him by the wrist and arm, and shoved him into a metal pipe, breaking the arm. After a knee to the head the wolf was incapacitated.

As he walked inside he could hear an alarm ringing. He knew there must have been more men there. He hid in a corner and pulled out his cyberdeck. He then scanned the network and found one ongoing call originating from within and was able to intercept it. He could hear the caller saying : "...Ness just got taken out outside and now I'm on my own. I think we might be getting raided ourselves boss". "I'll pull the boys back from Jenova. It looks like they are getting heat over there too" replied a female voice, then dropped the call.

Joshua hacked the wolf's neural cellphone through the network and made it malfunction, beeping loudly inside the wolf's head and distracting him for a moment. Then, Joshua took that opportunity to run downstairs and knock out the wolf while he was agonizing with the loud sound. Joshua looked around quickly and was able to put 4 rifles and 8 grenades he found in a duffel bag. He also picked up a jumpdrive which ended up having a crypto wallet with a good amount of money. 

Knowing that reinforcements were coming, Joshua decided to leave, but not before wrecking the place. He broke three bottles of gin and soaked the couch, then set it on fire. He left in a hurry and did not look back. The place got torched and ruined after that.
