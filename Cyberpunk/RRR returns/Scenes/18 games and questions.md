Makai and Joshua drove to an abandoned arcade building and interrogated [[Tago Niagara]] inside. The dusty old arcades were littered with all sorts of garbage and broken beer bottles. Lights from the neon signs outside shone through cracks in the barred windows, and they could hear the sound of the subway racing outside not too far away.

Tago regained consciousness and looked around in a panic. His shirt had old dried blood in it, and his body was sore, but he could move freely. He was sitting on the cockpit of an old racing game. Joshua was smoking a cigarette close to him, and Makai was looking out the windows. They had taken his belongings and searched his phone, but did not find any valuable information.

"H-Hey there. My name is Tago, I'm sure there has been some sort of mix-up. I'm just an ordinary guy. You can take my things, but I don't have much money to give" he said. "Let's cut the bull-crap. Tell us what is your relationship with the wolves" answered Makai.

Tago's expression changed, he looked happy instead of afraid and replied "oh, so you are enemies with them hey? Listen, I am not married to them, you and I can do business instead. I can give you good contracts, my employer gives some generous pay". "And who would that be?" asked Makai. Tago faltered. Makai walked closer to Tago and raised his voice: "who is your boss?".

Tago leaned back away from Makai and said: "I don't know! There is some lady called [[Komarov]] who found me online and sends me instructions but I've never met her in person". "Tell us more about her" said Makai. Tago continued: "she is a [[Sentricus]] corpo, she reunited the [[Mad Wolf]] gang after they disbanded years ago and supplies them with weapons, I think she is using them as a tool against other companies. The wolves are loyal to her, she helps them get away with their plans too". 

"What kind of mission have they been doing for her?" Makai asked. "We were in the middle of one before you showed up. That guy who was with me at the bar was a scientist who works for [[Structial Biocorp]], we were arranging a deal with him. She has been gathering a bunch of nerds for a secret project, the wolves have been raiding all sorts of chemical facilities as well. I have no clue what she needs these things for". 

"Some sort of bio-weapon no doubt" said Joshua, then he continued: "Where are the scientists being put to work?". Tago shook his head: "I don't know man, she only uses me for financial transactions I don't know what happens after they get hired. I've told you all I know, I've got to get going, I'm bleeding here".

"Very well" said Joshua. "Don't tell anyone about this encounter. You were just robbed after a car crash." he continued as he handed Tago his phone. Joshua had inserted a tracker daemon in Tago's phone while he was unconscious.

"Before you go. Tell us where is the headquarters for the [[Mad Wolf]] gang" said Makai. "I really don't know, I'm sorry. Like I said I only handle the pay cheques. I meet those guys at bars and clubs, I wouldn't want to follow them to whatever cursed hole they sleep in".
