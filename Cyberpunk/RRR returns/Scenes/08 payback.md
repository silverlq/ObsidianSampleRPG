Later that day Makai gathered his things and got ready to leave for the [[Scarlet Hills]] to talk to [[Gwendolin]]. He left [[Jenova]] in his car and drove south-east towards the Far Walk road. At that point he got a message from [[Tyson]]: "Wolves in Jenova. Armed guys looking for you. Do not come back".

Makai knew he had to come back. Tyson was in danger. He turned around and sped as fast as he could. As he entered Jenova, he saw two black SUVs driving around and in it he recognized one of the faces he had seen in the wolves den a week ago. Makai parked his car in front of a noodle shop a couple of blocks away from Tyson's house and decided to continue on foot.

He snuck through the back streets and arrived in Tyson's back yard. He could hear a conversation going on at the front. He also noticed the neighbors were looking out the window to see what was happening. He quietly approached the front behind the wooden side-fence to listen to the conversation.

"If you don't give us that boy, we will have to kill you old man, and others. You know that we won't leave without blood" said a tall bald man. "The boy is long gone Fergus, he knew you were looking for him" replied Tyson.

Makai could see from a gap in the fence. There were 5 men there at the front talking to Tyson. Fergus spat on the floor. "Bullshit!" he said. Then he turned towards Tyson's dog Blaze, pointed his gun and shot him. The dog was dead. "Damn you!" exclaimed Tyson. "Shut up asshole!" said another man next to Fergus, then he kicked Tyson in the stomach, who fell to the floor.

At this moment Makai saw that one of Tyson's neighbors, a man called Zack was sneaking towards him with a shotgun in hand. "Let's get them" he whispered. Makai aimed his pistol towards Fergus. He held his breath, then pulled the trigger. The bullet pierced his chest through the side, and he was down. Zack fired his shotgun and killed another one. The men all started running to take cover.

Everyone started shooting, more wolves arrived, as well as other neighbors who shot at the invaders. One of the wolves shot Makai with an SMG and hit him in the chest through his armor and he started bleeding. He took a deep breath, aimed and shot the man who injured him, who got shot in the stomach and fell. Another wave of bullets flew over Makai's head. He shot another man dead.

At that moment someone screamed "Go! Go!" and the mad wolves retreated back to their SUVs. Makai and others kept shooting until they sped away from town.

Tyson was hugging Blaze's corpse with a sad expression. "They'll pay for this" Makai said.
