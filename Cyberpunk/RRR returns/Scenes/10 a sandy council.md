Joshua met with Makai and Tyson the day after Jenova was attacked and told them what had happened. "So it sounds like there is a corpo woman coordinating them, from [[Sentricus]] no doubt" said Tyson. The three of them decided to go see [[Gwendolin]] right away, but Tyson changed his mind at the last minute "You boys go see her, I am too old for this. And I need to bury my dog. My poor old Blaze".

So Makai, Joshua, and Zack, Tyson's neighbor who tagged along, drove down the Far Walk road and approached the [[Scarlet Hills]] settlement. That place was made from the wreckage of trains, trucks and concrete walls, set against the sandy slopes of Scarlet Peak.

Guards barred the front gate. Makai parked near it,  then the guards walked towards the car window. "Makai, Joshua. I'm glad to see that you are doing okay. We've heard there was a gun-fight in Jenova. Come inside, I am sure you have news for us" one of them said. Makai and the others were led to a large metal and concrete structure, filled with vehicle parts, barrels, boxes, and other pieces of storage inside. It smelled of rust and dirt. They walked through rows of containers and arrived at a large dark chamber with a single ray of light illuminating a round rusty table around which four people were sitting. One of them was [[Gwendolin]].

Makai and Joshua told them all they had seen and heard from the mad wolves. Then, Joshua opened his duffel bag and showed them the equipment he had found in their hideout before it burned. "We need your help Gwendolin, I will not rest until those dirty dogs have been wiped and I can't do it alone. Please, the people of Jenova are your friends and family as well" pleaded Makai.

From her dark seat, they could see Gwendolin's shiny blue eyes piercing the darkness from underneath her hood as she said: "[[Atohi]] was a dear friend of mine. Fuck those rotten [[Mad Wolf|mad wolves]] for having done what they did. But these gang wars have got to stop. We slaughter ourselves in the dirt while the wealthy prosper and laugh at us from their shiny towers. Enough blood has been spilled on our side". "But" Makai started to speak but Gwendolin lifted her shiny scarlet hand and spoke again: "Don't get me wrong, the mad wolves are trash and I would gladly end them. But we must first address the root of the problem. There is clearly a corpo in charge of them. Once we cut those ties, we can clean the garbage".

They discussed different ideas on how to further investigate the ties between the wolves and the corporations, but no-one knew how to find that person Joshua heard when he intercepted the call. Then Joshua suggested: "I could take the jump-drive with the crypto money I found in the wolves den to my contact in [[Orquay Investments]] and she might be able to trace back the money to someone in [[Sentricus]]". "That is a good lead, good thinking Joshua" said Makai. Then Gwendolin stood up and said: "You two go digging for info. I will send some of my men to protect Jenova so you won't have to worry about retaliation. That is all wee need to discuss for now" then she left the room.
