A couple of minutes later, while Makai was walking towards a subway station he received a call from Joshua: "Makai! I'm being chased! I'm shot! It's the wolves, somehow they found me. Hold on, the cops are here!". "Joshua, hang tight! I think this was a setup, there was a trap in the auditor's desk" Makai said. The cops scared away Joshua's pursuers and after filling a police report he was free to go meet Makai.

They were parked in front of an auto-repair shop treating their wounds with a first aid kit that Joshua had in his trunk, when suddenly Joshua received a call. He looked surprised, then added Makai to the call. It was [[Elvira Yara]]: "hello dear, how is your endeavor going?" Joshua did not respond for a moment, then he and Makai looked at each other. They were suspicious of her. 

"Hello?" she asked again. "We've had an incident" said Joshua. "Oh. Oh no, are you alright?" she asked concerned. She seemed genuine to Makai so he responded: "Hello miss Yara, the mad wolves were here. This was a trap". "A trap? Oh no. I swear I didn't know! What could those filthy animals want with me?" she said, with panic in her voice. "You don't have to worry about them Elvira, we were their targets. I'm thinking they have been following us and that guard I bribed was likely in their pockets" said Joshua.

"Is that why you came to me with that money stick? Are you in trouble with the gang?" she asked. Joshua and Makai did not respond so she continued: "Is there any way I could help? Please, I don't want you to think I wanted to cause you any harm". "It's alright Elvira, just wire us the payment as Makai successfully installed the daemon before the computer got destroyed. We'll be fine".

At that moment they noticed a figure approaching the car from the repair shop, who must have been there for a while listening to their conversation. Joshua dropped the call and Makai pulled out his gun and said "hold on right there!". It was a kid. Makai put his gun away: "sorry kid, I didn't mean to scare you, I thought you were someone else. My name is Makai, are you looking for someone?".

"Hi Makai, I am [[Milo Majors]], my dad owns this repair shop. Are you scared of the mad wolves? Is that why you pulled the gun?" the kid asked. "Nah Milo, you shouldn't be worrying about gangs and guns, or talking to strangers this late in the night" Makai replied. "My dad hates the wolves, he says they are the worst guys. He will never fix their cars again, because they don't pay their bills" the kid said.

Then Makai and Joshua looked at each other, and they both knew what the other was thinking,
