Over the following week, Joshua monitored Tago's movements remotely via the tracker daemon that was installed in Tago's phone. Makai took some time to visit his sister and see how she was doing. 

[[Catori]] was not doing well, she was unconscious most of the time and constantly hooked up to respirators and monitors. Her lungs were sensitive and could not handle unfiltered air, much less the polluted city air that she had been breathing before she came to the long-term care clinic. The doctors gave Makai and [[Enoli]] the bad news that Catori was unlikely to survive much longer, as her lungs were deteriorating rapidly.

Over one such visits to the clinic, Makai received a call from [[Gwendolin]]: "Makai, where are you?" she asked, with a raspy voice. "Gwendolin, I'm with my sister in High Banks, what's wrong?" he replied. "So you dont know" she said with a sorrowful tone, and continued: "turn on the Modus News channel" she said.

Makai turned on the holo screen and switched the channel to Modus News Network. There were images of an empty sub-urban neighborhood, cars with open doors, a bicycle on the street, and a helicopter patrolling the area. The captions showed: "Breaking News! Village of [[Jenova]] blasted with toxic gas". The reporter on air said: "...the general public is advised not to approach the perimeter of the town and to avoid driving south via the Smokespeed Highway as the southern winds may carry the toxins up to the edge of High Banks. Locals have been evacuated and are being taken to a shelter in the farm fields near the Far Walk road".

"What on earth is happening?" asked Makai. 
"No one has died yet, but most people are hurt and some are in terrible shape. My men that were on watch reported seeing drones dropping explosive canisters before the people started coughing" she said. "That... Is horrible" said Makai terrified. Gwendolin replied "Makai, I had sent six of my men to protect Jenova from gangsters, not fight a fleet of war drones. We are not prepared to win this war, and I'm afraid that the [[Scarlet Hills]] are next". 

Makai stood up and looked outside southwards and said: "Joshua and I discovered that the mad wolves are helping a [[Sentricus]] corpo named [[Komarov]] to develop some bioweapon. The bastards must have deployed a prototype of it in Jenova. Gwendolin, I think Joshua may be able to track one of [[Komarov]]'s men to their base of operations. If he does we may be able to put an end to this madness by destroying their lab".

"Keep me posted, I need to go now" said Gwendolin, then she dropped the call. Makai looked back to [[Catori]] and said: "Stay strong sister, please. I'll come back to you after I find this secret lab. I can't let them hurt more people".
