Makai and Joshua decided to drive by and spy on [[Tekonika]]'s office, which was located in a remote sector with few large buildings and a view to the badlands. The office was a large blocky building, with bright concrete and dark glass. At the entrance there were palm trees around a fountain.

Little did they know that they were being observed. They were parked at a parking lot not too far from the building where they could see employees entering the building. After a couple of hours they noticed a man leaving the office carrying a laptop, and entering a car in the same parking lot as them. They decided to follow him.

As soon as they started following the employee, Makai noticed a black SUV behind him that seemed to be following them. "They are here after us again" he said. They continued following the target, keeping their distance and paying attention to the SUV, which was not far behind. 

The target stopped at a gas station, then went inside the shop while his car was filling up. "This is it! You drive!" said Makai, as he left the car in a hurry and approached the target vehicle swiftly while crouching. The car windows were down and the laptop was just sitting there on the passenger's seat. Makai grabbed it and raced back to Joshua. He took the driver's seat again.

Joshua did not waste time and started hacking into the laptop using his cyberdeck. Makai drove away in a hurry in an attempt to lose the pursuers. The SUV revved towards them and stayed within line of sight. Makai took a turn into a dirt road and spotted a line of large dump trucks nearby. He drove through them and into another turn, taking another ramp into a different highway. At that point the SUV had lost them.

They parked at the back of a nightclub while Joshua searched the laptop. He was able to find e-mails saying how [[Tago Niagara]] used to be a prized marketeer for the company, and had been fired all of a sudden with direct orders from upper management, and none of his co-workers knew the reason why. Joshua also found Tago's personal contact information and a picture of him at [[Sharp's bar]] at a happy hour gathering. Joshua did not find anything about [[Komarov]] or the mad wolves.
