The room they had entered had tall black walls beautifully adorned with gold trim. Thousands of wires hung from the ceiling and met at the center of the room in a large metal sphere that pulsated with energy.

"My sister and I must connect with the mainframe and dive into the cyberspace. We should be able to disable the robots from there and erradicate [[Komarov]]" Mizu said. "Sister, I don't think I can" said Yurei, holding her chest. Blood poured from a wound. "I'll take her place, I have a cyberspace implant" said Joshua.

So Joshua and Mizu hooked up to Mizu's cyberspace deck and connected it to the a port near the metal sphere. They laid down on the floor and were transported to the cyberspace. Ashton soldered the hinges of the door at the entrance with a portable blast-torch and Makai treated his and Yurei's wounds.

Joshua opened his eyes but he could not see anything. He could not feel anything, not even the floor beneath his feet. "Mizu, are you there?" he asked. "I'm here, hold on a minute" she hacked the node's infrastructure and turned on the lights. They looked around them and saw the interior of an old space station from the twentieth century. They were floating around inside it in zero gravity.

"A space station... I assume we need to find some sort of cockpit or control room" Joshua thought out loud. He grabbed a handle nearby and propelled himself towards a door. Then he opened the hatch and floated through it. He found himself in a long corridor with damaged walls and faulty equipment. There were windows through which he could see a distant planet Earth floating outside in space. He also saw astronauts both inside and out of the station, working and repairing equipment.

As Mizu caught up with Joshua, one of the astronauts aboard approached them and asked: "where are you two coming from? I do not recognize you". "We were sent to inspect the cockpit for damage. We do not want our most mission critical systems to go out of commission" Joshua replied. The astronaut gave them a good look and said: "very well, the cockpit is this way".

The astronaut led them through the corridor and into a bright room, directly illuminated by the distant sun, beaming through large glass cupola.
There was a woman in the room in fetal position, floating in the sun beam. "Captain Komarov, these two are here to help us with the damage" the astronaut said.

The woman straightened her back and looked at them. Her eyes were blazing red with pulsating energy, and so was her hair. "Spies!" she hissed as she pointed towards them: "What are worms such as you doing in here? Please don't tell me you think you stand a chance against me in my domain. My robots will soon breach the room and kill you all".

"You have kidnapped, maimed and killed my people. You are a soulless creation of a greedy corporation and it is about time that you got some payback" confronted Mizu, floating gently towards Komarov. 

The astronaut that had led them into this room grabbed Joshua by the elbow. They started to wrestle, as the program was trying to eject Joshua from the system, and Joshua trying to deactivate the agent that was attacking him.

Mizu started to feel some resistance in the air as she got closer to Komarov, as if there was some sort of forcefield preventing her from continuing. "I pity you humans, such foolish, weak creatures. What did you think would happen? You cannot lay hands on me" Komarov said with arrogance.

Mizu had come prepared. She put on sunglasses and analyzed her surroundings using a procedure she had brought. Her code pinpointed a weakness in the systems that were surrounding Komarov. There was a panel not far from her that was able to partially depressurize the room, which would deactivate the forcefield. She floated towards it and activated the panel. Air started flowing out of the room towards floor vents.

"Maggot!" Komarov shouted, as she rushed towards Mizu. Komarov grabbed Mizu and her fiery hair grew longer and started to strangle Mizu, choking her and paralyzing her.

Joshua kicked the astronaut in the groin and punched him unconscious, temporarily stunning that defense agent. He saw that Mizu was in trouble so he floated towards her and screamed "let her go!".

Mizu, while being choked, grabbed a vial that was in her uniform, opened it and let it float away from her hands. From within the vial an energy serpent sprung and bit Komarov in the neck. Suddenly, Mizu's body flickered and disappeared. She had been kicked out of the system.

Komarov grunted and yanked the serpent, trying to pry it out from her neck but the serpent resisted. A glowing wound and luminous veins started to spread around the bite, as if some venom was being injected into Komarov's body. Joshua grabbed a loose astronaut's helmet nearby and smashed it on Komarov's head, shattering the visor and distracting her for a moment.

Komarov floated towards Joshua and her hair extended trying to grab one of his limbs, but he dodged and floated away. The serpent glowed brighter and bit harder, causing Komarov to flinch and grunt in pain. Joshua grabbed a large telephone that was on one of the machines nearby and used it to hit Komarov once again, but her hair deflected the attack.

At that moment the robots outside the mainframe room were finally able to burst in and started shooting at the group. Explosives that Ashton had placed near the door blasted the first few intruders into smithereens, but more robots started flowing in. Makai and Ashton opened fire at them.

Back in the cyberspace Joshua pursued Komarov, who started to retreat into the corridor outside the cockpit. Many astronauts approached towards them one of them stood now between Joshua and Komarov, who once again grunted in pain and struggled with the serpent. 

Joshua noticed an EVA suit close to him, as well as a jet-pack. He pulled the jet pack out of the wall and activated it, aiming towards Komarov and holding onto it as hard as he could. The jetpack propelled him forward with great speed, and he was able to tackle through the astronaut and crash onto her. Three other astronauts who were nearby all put hands on Joshua, trying to restrain him. But before they could pull him away, Joshua grabbed the serpent and shoved it further in to Komarov's neck. The venom spread into her face and the glow of her eyes flickered, then faded, as she lost her strength.

The astronauts all pulled Joshua away, but it was too late. Komarov had been eradicated by Mizu's serpent virus. Her body flickers, then disappears. All astronauts then loosen their grasp and let Joshua go. They ignore him and resume what they were doing before, going back to their ship repairs.
