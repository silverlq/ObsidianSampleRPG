Makai knew he could not stay there and fight all the men, so he ran upstairs as fast as he could. He could hear shouting and footsteps behind him of many men, likely more than just the four he had seen. As he reached the entrance he heard an alarm ringing, and more footsteps could be heard coming from upstairs.

He ran towards the door and tried to open it, but it would not budge as the display showed in red letters: "EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN". As a desperate move Makai pulled out a high voltage taser he carried and blasted the door lock with it: "BRRRRR". The display flickered and turned off. Then the door unlocked as the display said "Rebooting...".

Makai burst outside, as the men still inside started shooting at him with pistols and SMGs. The bullets flew beside him, piercing the walls and floor around him as he ran through the alley. As he was turning the corner to a street one of the shots hit him in the middle of his spine. His armored vest protected him from any serious injury but the impact shook him hard. 

He grunted as he dove outside of range of his attackers. He could see a drop straight ahead that could lead him into the underground subway station and out of sight. He vaulted over the rail guard and slid through a concrete ramp, then fell on a platform 8 meters below. His legs suffered a great impact and intense pain flared up from his feet and knees.

Makai hobbled through the path downstairs to the subway station. He finally reached the train platform, and walked into a crowd that was there waiting for a ride. A few minutes passed and Makai saw his pursuers walking down the stairs that led to the platform, but at that moment the train arrived. He blended into the crowd and was not seen entering a car.
