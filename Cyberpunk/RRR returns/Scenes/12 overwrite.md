Makai and Joshua made plans to infiltrate the government building and infect the auditor's computer with Yara's daemon. She also promised them a monetary reward for doing so. Joshua was able to obtain floorplans for the building and locate Jianjun's desk in it. They also obtained a janitor disguise for Makai to wear. Joshua bribed Poulomi, one of the guards of the building to let Makai in the next day, but she would not let him bring any weapons inside. He decided to bring a hidden switchblade.

The next day at sunset, when the building was mostly empty, Makai and Joshua drove to an empty backstreet near the Eastern Sky plaza. The wind was cold and dark stormy clouds were approaching from the southwest. "I'll guide you Makai, you got this" said Joshua as he handed the daemon jumpdrive over.

Makai stepped out of the vehicle and approached a metal door at the back of the government building, then he knocked. Poulomi opened the door and let him in, locking the door behind them. She took a quick look at him and said: "you have one hour. You can send me a message and I will unlock this door for you, but after one hour my shift will be over" then she walked away.

Joshua guided Makai through quiet dark halls and elevators, up to the 30th floor. He found all doors unlocked along the way to the auditor's desk. Everything seemed too easy to Makai. At the auditor's desk he found some documents about [[Elvira Yara]], describing some financial information about her assets. When he plugged in the jumpdrive he could see the words "Overwritting database..." on the screen. 

Suddenly, a beeping sound started coming from underneath the desk, but Makai noticed it too late. An explosion sent him flying with a loud bang, along with desk and computer fragments, and numerous files and papers. Makai hit a wall and his head started bleeding. A cloud of dust filled the room and he could not see anything for an instant. Then, a fire suppression system turned on an started showering the room, and a loud ringing started.

Although a bit dizzy and in pain, aside from his head injury Makai did not suffer any severe damage to the rest of his body. He was very lucky to be alive. He groaned and stood on his knee, touching his head near the injury. "Joshua, this was a set up. There was an explosion. Joshua, are you there?" Makai said but there was no response. Then he heard footsteps approaching. His instincts told him to hide, so he immediately moved behind a row of cubicles away from the blasted zone.

He then saw the guard Poulomi approaching, she moved towards the destroyed desk with her handgun drawn. She started looking around frantically. Makai did not know if he could trust her, especially since she had her handgun drawn. So he snuck out through the emergency exit via the stairwell. He climbed down the 30 levels and was able to exit the building through a different side than he entered.

He turned around the corner and looked for Joshua's car but it wasn't there. There was no trace of him, he had vanished.
