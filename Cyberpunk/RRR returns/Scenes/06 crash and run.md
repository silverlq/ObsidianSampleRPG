Makai drove through the neon-lit roads in the night. A thin rain rolled around the windows of his truck. He crossed great bridges and tunnels and finally arrived at the Tarka red-light district, a popular place for night clubs, bars, and other dark places for lust and pleasure.

As he approached the [[Ice Cubes Club]], Makai circled the parking lot and started looking for Levi's car. He did not have to look for long before he found it. It was a black armored muscle car. "This looks tougher than I thought. I will have to ram it really hard to get the trunk to open" Makai thought.

He circled around the parking lot one more time and looked for any guards or other surveillance, but could not see much movement. Then, he stepped on the gas pedal hard, turning his truck towards the rear end of Levi's car. The truck roared as it sped through the lot, and crashed with tremendous force right on target. Both cars were left incredibly damaged. Makai's legs that were already in pain from the fall he had suffered earlier that day swelled with pain. The old truck Makai got from Tyson could not withstand such an impact and died, and not only that but the engine also immediately burst on fire. 

Makai, opened the door and stumbled out. He could immediately see the laptop inside the trunk of the muscle car, which got crushed and opened. Suprisingly, the laptop was left unscathed. He grabbed it and stumbled as fast as his injured legs would let him, disappearing in the night.
