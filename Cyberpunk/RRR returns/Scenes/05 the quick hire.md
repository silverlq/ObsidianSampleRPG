After a few more drinks with Joshua, Makai went back to his truck. He had received another delivery request. After a couple more deliveries he headed home. The sun was setting as he was leaving [[High Banks]] via the Smokespeed highway. At that time his phone rang, it was an unknown caller.

"Mr Makai?" asked the voice of a female. "Speaking" he replied. "Mr Makai, this is [[Elvira Yara]], you may have heard about me from a common contact of ours" she said. "Holy smokes, Joshua works fast" Makai said to himself. "I understand you are looking for work, correct?" Elvira asked. "Yes ma'am. I am available" he replied without thinking. "Tonight? I need you tonight" she asked. "That... You need a bodyguard tonight?" Makai said a bit confused. "Not a bodyguard. I need you to damage a vehicle, and retrieve a laptop, this is time sensitive. I will pay you hansomely for this. Ninety-five hundred." she said.

Makai's eyes widened, he felt his heart race. He had to take this opportunity. He had been slaving doing deliveries for far too long. He was not meant to be a faceless drone, a cog in the machine. He needed change in his life. The money would help sustain his family as well. "I'll take it!" he exclaimed.

"Good" continued Elvira: "You are looking for a man called Levi Hyung. He works for my company [[Orquay Investments]] and he must not know you and I have any ties. He is a piece of shit back-stabber and is trying to displace me and steal my clients. Tonight he is going to the cursed hole called the [[Ice Cubes Club]]. Your job is to wreck his car, he loves that disgusting thing. In the trunk there should be a laptop, he always leaves it there. I only need the memory drive in it, I don't care if the laptop itself gets damaged. You got it?". "Yes ma'am. I'll bring you that laptop" Makai replied. "You can drop it off with Joshua. I'm sending you the details on Levi's car so you can find it. Good luck" and she dropped the call.

After that, Makai stopped by [[Tyson]]'s house in [[Jenova]] and bought one of his old trucks that was untraceable. It would be perfect for the job. Then, he headed towards the [[Ice Cubes Club]].
