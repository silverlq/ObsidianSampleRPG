They entered a locker area. It was dark and eerily silent inside. As soon as the door closed behind them Joshua's coughing worsened and he fell to his knees. At that moment they heard footsteps coming from the dark room ahead of them. Four guards started shooting while taking cover behind bullet-proof glass doors.

Bullets flew around them and the room lit up with the muzzle flashes. Makai retaliated and hit one of them right in the neck, while Mizu hit another in the chest. Then Ashton threw one of his grenades and took out the guard that Mizu had wounded. Makai was hit and hid behind a locker for cover. Mizu sprayed the enemy with bullets. Makai reloaded, fought the pain and opened fire, killing the last two guards.

"I think Joshua here needs our attention" said Ashton, holding Joshua, who laid unconsious on the ground. Yurei, who was feeling better took of her mask and said to Makai: "he is not breathing, take off his mask quickly. You, pinch his nose and breathe into his mouth". Makai followed her instructions, and Yurei poured some water from a bottle nearby on Joshua's face.

He started breathing again: "What... Happened? Where..". Makai tapped him on the back: "save your breath, brother. Yurei here saved your life". While they were talking, Mizu went over the lockers and retrieved her and her sister's belongings that had been stored away.

While she got dressed Mizu asked: "I heard you asking the corpo back there about [[Komarov]]. Were you sent here to destroy it?". "It? I thought Komarov was a she" Makai responded.

Mizu and her sister Yurei giggled. Then she said: "Amateurs. Komarov is an advanced AI developed by Sentricus. It has gone rogue and started this operation on its own. It discovered us when we were trying to hack into their system". "An AI? This is messed up, we can't kill that" replied Ashton.

"We can" said Mizu. "We know the AI is hiding in the cyberspace and there must be an entry node to get through it's firewall in a computer somewhere in this facility. If we can get there, we can kill it".

"Why are you so keen on destroying this thing?" asked Ashton. Yurei saddened and answered: "That monster has been kidnapping and doing experiments on people from our community for years. When street kids and bums go missing in High Banks no one else seems to care, but they were our brothers and sisters".

"We should... Press on..." said Joshua, standing up slowly.
