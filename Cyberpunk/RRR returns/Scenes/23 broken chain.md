They decided to look into the machinery room where Ashton could hear a robot first. Ashton unlocked the door using his tools, and peeked inside before entering. It was indeed a great server room with many tall computer stacks. It was dimly lit, and they could hear and see a small robot moving around the computers, connecting and disconnecting chips and cables in them. "It is a server maintenance bot" said Joshua relieved "it is not going to attack us or alert anyone that we are here". "But" said Ashton, pointing towards the floor: "there are laser sensors here, let's not find out what happens if we trigger them". They carefully avoided the lasers, then investigated the room. They found a desk with an access terminal, a bunch of blank jump drives and an old pizza box. Joshua jacked in, and was able to gain access into the server farm.

Joshua found a library of thousands of books on bio-engineering, chemistry, anatomy, nano-biology and other topics. He also found a description of their location: an underground hangar and R&D lab for housing the next generation of bio-weapon technology. Finally, he was also able to access some footage of human trials showing that they tested the efficacy of the toxin in prisoners. The main purpose of the server was to assist and process the results of the scientific research being conducted there, although details of the research were difficult to interpret. "Let's save this evidence and prepare to blow up this server" said Makai. Joshua saved some of the files in his cyberdeck and Ashton placed various C4 packages for remote detonation around the server farm.

They went back to the other door, and Ashton unlocked it with ease. They were ready for a fight since they knew there would likely be guards there. They snuck into a large room filled with machines, barrels, fork-lifts and desks with computers. Four scientists in lab coats were discussing something. One of them said: "You are mistaken, we need to use a more powerful reaction agent and reduce the initial bonding, otherwise the target cells will have enough time to fight the infection". The other replied: "fair enough, we can give this one a shot then" and pointed towards one of the barrels. "Hey, you! Help us take this inside" he said towards a guard nearby. The guard took a forklift and lifted the barrel, moving it into another corridor out of sight, followed by the scientists.

There were three guards left in the room when a grunting noise could be heard coming from a different direction. Loud slapping of bare feet could be heard coming from a corridor. "Come back here!" said a voice. Ashton watched a tall skinny woman enter the room running wearing nothing but a hospital gown. A guard chased her and grabbed her by the hand, but she took a metal crowbar nearby and hit him in the head. She was free again and kept running, but the three guards in the room saw her and moved towards her. "We have to save her" Ashton said.

Makai and Ashton opened fire against two of the guards, who were not hit but stumbled and were shocked by the surprise attack. Joshua hit another one of the guards on the chest, who fell dead. The guards took cover behind some desks and started shooting back. The man who got hit with the crowbar got up and caught up with the woman, tackling her on to the ground next to some stairs. She screamed and struggled but could not free herself. Makai swiftly moved between covers, rolling behind a pile of barrels closer to the woman, then shot at a guard, hitting his armored vest. Two guards shot back at Makai with an SMG and an assault rifle. The bullets pierced through the barrels and reacted with the substance inside, emitting a dense cloud of mist that blinded Makai. The third guard that had been fighting the woman pulled her up from the floor and hid behind her as a human shield while holding his pistol.

Makai moved away from the mist, rolling behind a box with a better line of sight towards the guards. The woman was still struggling and fighting, she hit her aggressor in the groin and ran away from him. He did not pursue her and decided to shoot at Makai instead, but his bullets where stopped by the wooden box Makai was using as cover. However, the man with the SMG was able to pierce through the box, grazing Makai in the knee. Another guard with an assault rifle was able to hit Ashton, who fell bleeding and screaming in pain. The woman picked up the other assault rifle by the guard that Joshua had killed and open fire against the guards, killing one of them. The two remaining guards returned fire, assailing the woman with bullets, and she fell wounded to the ground. Makai shot the guard that was holding an SMG in the chest. Then, the woman still on the ground aimed the rifle at the last guard and sprayed him with bullets, hitting him on several places.

"Are you okay?" asked Makai. "I'm fine" she responded: "I got hit in the leg but I can still walk". Then he walked towards Ashton. He was wounded and semi-conscious on the floor and he could not stand. "This is how I die, my friend. Take this" he said as he handed the remote detonator to Makai. "You are not dying here Ashton" said Makai as he grabbed the detonator, and then he pulled a trauma stim-pack from his backpack and injected it in Ashton, who got a rush of adrenaline. "Asshole! I was ready to die, this was my moment" Ashton said, as he stood up on one knee. "You know what we should keep going, I can walk now" he said, grunting.

"If you are here to fuck this place up then count me in. But first we need to set my sister free. Follow me" said the woman. The three of them looked at each other and then nodded.
