The [[Sentricus]] corporation had been financing the [[Mad Wolf]] gang long before the end of the [[Red Road Riders]] during the gang wars. [[Makai]] thinks they are still having dealings now even though the gangs are mostly disbanded. From time to time, he monitored from afar some of the ex-members of the Mad Wolf who now mostly act as scammers and thieves.

One winter morning, Makai finished a truck delivery at the industrial sector and went to a coffee shop for a drink. He recognized one of the customers inside: a tall man wearing a Sentricus hat, one of the mad wolves. He followed the guy from a distance, got in the subway behind him and watched him from the opposite end of the car.

They left the sub at a residential sector called [[Nuyama]], and walked towards a busy street. The tall man turned into a dark alley and passed a row of dumpsters being used by some street kids as shelter. He then walked to a rusty door, opened it and walked inside. Makai watched from afar, and waited for about 20 minutes.

After getting impatient he approached the door and tried to open it but it was locked. He looked for windows where he could peek inside but they were all obstructed from the inside. He walked around the building to look for other entrances, and after not finding any turned around. At that moment two men approached him: "are you lost little puppy? I can throw you a bone...".

Makai recognized those two. They were there the day that his father was killed. He wasted no time and quickly drew his pistol, then fired at the man who spoke and took cover behind a metal pipe. That man was shot in the neck and fell dead where he stood. The other screamed: "bastard! Die you scum!". He took cover and shot at Makai but the bullet hit the edge of the pipe and was deflected elsewhere.

They exchanged a few shots, Makai got hit on his robotic arm without any damage, then finally he dropped the man with a head shot.
