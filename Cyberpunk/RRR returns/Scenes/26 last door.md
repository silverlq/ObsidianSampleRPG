"Right up ahead is the mainframe that sends commands to the drones and defense bots. It should have access to [[Komarov]]'s inner nodes in the cyberspace. The problem is that door over there is guarded by soldier bots" said Mizu, as she looked over the railing of a balcony down to an atrium. Quaruped robots patrolled at the bottom around a fountain, and in front of a heavy metal door there stood two of the slender robots that they had seen before.

"Can we try a distraction?" asked Ashton. "What if we blow up the research server from here?". Makai nodded "some of them may go investigate. Let's do it". They snuck behind the railing towards a corner, then Makai pulled the detonator from his pack and turned the key. They felt the tremor of the explosion under their feet, then they heard a low distant rumble.

After a couple of minutes they heard the mechanical sound of robot legs approaching. Three robots had left their post downstairs to investigate the explosion. There were a total of four robots left in the atrium. They split up, Makai and Joshua went after two robots and Ashton and the sisters went after the other two. They signaled and opened fire at the same time. Grenades exploded and volleys of bullets assailed the robots until their metal carcasses got completely wrecked.

An alarm rang and the lights around them started flashing red. "Quickly! We have to get inside!" Mizu said. They ran towards the metal door. Ashton grabbed his tools and pried open a control panel, then started analyzing how to unlock the door. "It is doable, I just need a minute!". 

Many robots aproached from all sides of the atrium and opened fire against them. They did not have any cover so Makai, Mizu and Yurei were injured while Ashton was trying to unlock the door. When the door finally opened, they rushed inside and locked the door behind them.
