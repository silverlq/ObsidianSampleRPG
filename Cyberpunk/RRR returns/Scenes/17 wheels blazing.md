Makai's car revved as they tried to keep up with [[Tago Niagara]], who was driving erratically through other cars. They turned sharp corners around a busy neighborhood, barely missing other cars and people.

Makai closed the distance between them, but Tago kept pressing on. Joshua started shooting at their wheels to try and stop them.
Their bumpers slammed, the wheels screeched leaving rubber marks behind. At that moment Tago's car was crossing a truck carrying metal barrels with bright neon signs saying "DANGER! FLAMMABLE". Both Joshua and Makai immediately started shooting a barrel closest to Tago. It did not take much to explode with a violent bang and a giant ball of fire.

Tago's windshield was engulfed in flames, and his car was blown out of control, turning violently and then spinning out of controll, then crashing against a concrete wall. Makai's car was also pushed by the shockwave and lost traction, turning and crashing not far behind Tago. The truck exploded in a million pieces.

Joshua was a bit shaken from the crash, but Makai did not lose time and leapt out of the car, running towards his target. Tago and his passenger were both injured, but not dead, and their car was no longer on flames, but the engine block and the transmission were completely wrecked. 

Makai pulled a semi-conscious Tago out of his car and dragged him towards his own vehicle. Joshua had already taken the driver's seat and was backing out towards them. Their car was scratched and dented, but did not suffer any serious damage. Makai and Tago got in the back seat and Makai screamed "Let's bail Joshua!".
