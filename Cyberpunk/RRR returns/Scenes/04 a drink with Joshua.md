Makai switched trains and stopped at the [[Tall Reach Commerce]] district. It was around noon now, but the sun could barely reach the deep streets, buried beneath gargantuan sky scrapers. Shops were ever present with bright neon signs and extravagant advertisements.

There was a foul toxic haze near the ground because of all the pollution being ejected from vents, vehicles and the sewers underground. Many homeless people could be seen in these streets, often coughing and itching their eyes because of the polluted air.

Makai walked through a square brightly lit with an enormous suspended hologram of a playful dragon. The creature danced and twirled, then exited its display area leaving behind a slogan: "Dracogear, strong, reliable, fast".

He then entered a bar called [[Vagabond]], approached the bartender and said:
"[[Joshua]], brother it is good to see you.".
"Makai, long time no see my friend. You look rattled, let me serve you a drink, on the house".

Makai and Joshua were both ex members of the [[Red Road Riders]] MC. They discussed what Makai had seen. "I think the Mad Wolf gang is getting back together." Makai said. "There were a great number of them in that building, and I heard them saying they were having some sort of important dealing with a corpo. We can't just let them get away with what they've done and continue to do" he continued.

"I share your anger towards those bastards, and your wish for revenge, Makai" Joshua said. "However, they seem to be many, and we are few and have all scattered. What you need to do first is to gather resources and prepare a plan. I happen to know of a business opportunity for you, if you are interested".

"Joshua, blessed be your name. You are right, I need to be cautious and I could really use some work right about now" Makai said as he finished his drink. "Then listen, there is a lady called [[Elvira Yara]], she is a manager of a high-stakes trading company, and she is looking for a skilled driver and bodyguard for a special job. You take this job and I'll get a finder's fee. Knowing you it will be piece of cake so it is a win-win my friend" Joshua said with a grin.
