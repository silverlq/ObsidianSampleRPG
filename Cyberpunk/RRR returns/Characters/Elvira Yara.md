Manager at the high-stakes trading company [[Orquay Investments]], Elvira is a a middle-aged latina with wavy brown hair and piercing eyes. She is a powerful figure, always followed by body-guards, since she got famous for quickly amassing vast amounts of wealth for her companies, while causing others to crash and burn. She has also been rumored to betray some of her ex-employers, which is likely the reason why she started getting paranoid of sudden retribution.
She also fears a thorough auditing of her finances since she has taken quite a few liberties with moving assets around that may or may not have been legally hers to take.
