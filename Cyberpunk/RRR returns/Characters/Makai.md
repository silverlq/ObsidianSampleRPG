Makai Sparks is a truck driver and trader who often travels between communities in the badlands around the megacity of [[High Banks]] and the industrial sector. He is also a former member of the [[Red Road Riders]] (RRR) MC and son of [[Atohi]], the deceased leader of the MC. 
Makai is a brave young man of indigenous heritage, he has a slim build, short black hair, and mechanical arms that have replaced his biological limbs after a childhood accident. He still often wears his RRR jacket even though the MC has disbanded.
His's mother [[Enoli]] and his sister [[Catori]] live in a small apartment in the town of [[Jenova]], on the badlands near the outskirts of [[High Banks]]. His main priorities are to provide for them and to find a cure for [[Catori]]'s illness.
Vengeance is also something he secretly desires, as he still has flashbacks from the day when the [[Mad Wolf]] gang slaughtered his father and brother during the gang wars.
