I am at [[Summersong]], and I swore an iron vow to aid Gawnir to aid him with his troubles.
```iron-vault-mechanics
move "[Swear an Iron Vow](datasworn:move:classic\/quest\/swear_an_iron_vow)" {
    roll "Heart" action=5 adds=0 stat=2 vs1=6 vs2=5
}
```
Was Gawnir blamed for killing a man in the forest, when in reality the man was killed by a beast?
```iron-vault-mechanics
oracle name="[Ask the Oracle \/ Likely](datasworn:move.oracle_rollable:classic\/fate\/ask_the_oracle.likely)" result="Yes" roll=65
```
I ask Gawnir: What was the nature of this beast?
```iron-vault-mechanics
oracle name="[Action and Theme Oracles \/ Theme](datasworn:oracle_rollable:classic\/action_and_theme\/theme)" result="Portent" roll=68
```
A great winged creature with terrible jaws. Gawnir had been injured by the creature's tail.
