I rescued Gawnir when he was lost and starved in the forest and brought him to Summersong. He was being hunted for a crime he did not commit in his home settlement. His hunters have tracked him down to Summersong and are now demanding that we forfeit him or execute him. The village elders have given me the task of resolving the situation, since I was the one who brought him here. Gawnir has begged me to help him, and has sworn an iron vow himself that he has done nothing wrong and if he was lying that [[Gissa, goddess of secrets]] could punish him however she must. I have sworn to aid Gawnir in clearing his name.
