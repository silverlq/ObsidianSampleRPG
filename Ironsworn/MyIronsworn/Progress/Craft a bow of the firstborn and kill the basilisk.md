My great-grandfather had told me legends of the firstborn. It is said that elves lived in the old forests and had secret knowledge of how to craft legendary bows. He gave me a piece of twisted wood with runes that he claimed were once part of one such bows. I now carry this as a talisman for good luck. The settlement I was born in was flooded and then claimed by a terrible basilisk which killed many of my family and friends, who tried to fight it. I have sworn an iron vow to seek ancient knowledge, and with the aid of a powerful bow slay this creature.
