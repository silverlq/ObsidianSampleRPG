They walk inside. At the bottom of the stairs they walk into a beautiful room with large plants, a waterfall behind a glass panel, and two other exits. As they pass the metal door into this room it shuts behind them and a red light turns on and off, freaking them out.
With a hiss, the room starts to fill with toxic gas.

Tarte finds that the doors are all locked.
"Up here!" Zip finds a ventilation shaft on the top of the room, away from the toxic mist near the floor. She parkours her way up there and kicks the grate off of it. She gets a bit dizzy from the fumes. Tarte leaps on top of the fountain and then on to the shaft near the celing, grabbing onto Zip's hand. They both crawl through the duct as quick as they can.

They find themselves on top of another room, looking down through the grate. It is a bedroom with many bunk beds and lockers. There are two bloody sunrise sldier there but they are guarding a door, and Tarte spots an access card in the hands of one of them,

Zip carefully uses tarte's Knife to pryy open the grate without making a noise. She drops down into the room and hides behind a bed. Then she pulls out her handgun and points at one of the guards. Tarte pulls out the handgun he had gotten from the guard upstairs still inside the air duct and points at the other guard. Zip signals a countdown and they fire at the same time. They hit the guards. One of them stumbles and falls, the other turns around and fires back, barely missing Zip. Tarte fires twice, BANG - BANG, finishing off both guards.

They get the keycard, some ammo from the guards, and search the room, finding two hand grenades.

They heard a noise coming out of an adjacent room. The door that led there was semi open.

Zip and Tarte slowly walked there, it was a large circular room, wiht many chairs, white boards filled with complex formulas and equations. Tarte noticed someone hiding behind a desk.
"Hands up where I can see them!" Tarte said
The person crawled away from Tarte. They ran after them but they disappeared into a different room, leaving a badge behind.
Tarte looked at the badge, it was a scientist. "After him!"

They entered a storage room, and noticed many beautiful and odd crystals on display that they had never seen before. Bright lights shone at the crystals, lighting the room with otherworldly caustic projections.
"Doctor Warren Kree, we mean no harm. We are looking for doctor Elias Hagos. Do you know where we may find him?"
Slowly the scientist showed themselves. "I, Elias? Oh no.."

Tarte and Zip walked closer. "Tell us, what is wrong?"
"Elias died. He got sucked into the portal, it was unstable"
Tarte and Zip glanced at each other
"Damn. We are too late. Where is this portal?"
"This way, I can show you. But you must promise you will destroy it. This experiment has gone too far, it is madness"

At that moment a cultist jumped from behind a crate at tarte with a knife. Zip saw him coming and quickly put him down with a karate takedown. "Traitor!" the cultist screamed. The scientist recoiled. Zip choked the cultist unconscious. "Who are these cultists?" Tarte asked. 
"They are fanatics who believe this land has been chosen by alien gods. They are wrong. We initially though that the portal led into another planet or dimension and these spread as rumors across this country. However, the portal in fact leads into the future."

"Future? Wait a minute, so there are no aliens?" Zip asked
"Not really. But we got visitors from the future. They are not the saviours that the cultists think. I think these time travelers want to enslave this country. Currently only 4 of them got through to our timeline, but more are coming soon."

"Show us" Tarte said.

The scientist led them towards a locked tdoor. Tarte used the keycard to open it.

They looked into a very large and bright room filled with hundreds of monitors, some with static noise, others showing images of the forest outside, some of them showing images of cities and landscapes they did not recognize. In the center of the room four figures watched one of the larger monitors. Two female and one male. They were all tall, slender and had pale faces and blackened eyes. They carried assult rifles.

As soon as the door opened the scientist pulled tarte and whispered "careful, hide! That is them!"

Tarte and Zip retreated. All the monitors flashed more intensely for a moment. A light came from a door far across the room beyond the four figures and they all felt a tremor spreading across the floor. The four figures looked towards the flashing door and walked towards it. "That is the portal! It is opening now, we must stop them!" the scientist said.

Tarte and Zip looked at each other and nodded. They ran towards the room, Tarte threw a grenade at the four time travelers, they all were hit by the blast. Zip shot one of them. Tarte threw another grenade but one of the four kicked it and it exploded in a corner of the room. Then they fired at Tarte. Zip fired but missed, then they fired at her as well.

Tarte got shot in the chest, and fell to the ground. He was a dead man. He could feel death coming. But not now, it was not meant to be... 

He slapped himself. Time unwinded. He had just thrown the first grenade, and stopped himself from throwing the second. Instead, he took cover and shot with the pistol and killed one of the travelers.
Zip shot and killed another. 

The two remaining travelers fled towards the next room. Tarte threw the second grenade, it exploded killing one of them. The other was hit but got through the door and closed it behind him. It was a large metal door and it seemed locked.

"Warren! How do we get through?"
"I don't know! there is no other way in!"

Tarte fired at the door with the assault rifle that one of the travelers had dropped, where the lock mechanism would be.
Then he fired another long burst, until it was out of ammo. The bullets had pierced through the door, and it could now be easily forced open.

The door opened into a dark cavernous room, The walls were cracked and many tiny shiny crystals could be seen in the rock, similar to what they had seen in the previous room. There was a large circular portal in the middle of the room, adorned with some such crystals. Voltaic arcs could be seen bridging some of the crystals around the portal, and a strange draft of wind was circling it. The traveler was taking cover behind a control panel, and opened fire at them.
Zip fell. Tarte fired but missed. The traveler shot back, then Tarte fell.
Darkness engulfed their minds. The mission had failed....
