They walked a couple of hours through wet ferns, bogs and dense vegetation. The air around them was hot and humid. It was now about 5 PM. Tarte was sweating but not tired yet. "Anything?" asked Zip who started to get inpatient. "I hear running water" answered Tarte. They traversed a patch of tall grass and arrived at a winding river. 

The thick mist made it difficult to see, but Tarte was able to distinguish the silhouette of tall tents in an outpost not far across the river. Amid the structures there were also flickering lights moving. "I see tents, and... Torches? I think there is a group of people carrying torches around in a circle". "What the hell? Should we investigate?" asked Zip. "As long as we stay out of sight it might be worth it. There may be clues there to the location of the lab".

Zip looked for a vantage point, then climbed on a tall tree and waited there while Tarte crossed the river and crawled towards the tents. When he was about to climb out of the river bank he saw someone approaching from the encampment. He quickly ducked and slid down into some roots and branches, hiding from the figure. A hooded man apprached the river bank, only about 6 meters away from Tarte, and started peeing. Tarte, hidden from view, could see that the man had a shaved head and black paint across the eyes. There was something odd about him. There was a scent of cinnamon in the air. The man went back to the camp.

Tarte creeped back up out of the river bank and observed a group of 7 people dancing around in a circle carrying torches. They all had shaved heads and painted faces. Tarte snuck up to a tent and looked inside. He found some car keys alongside jugs of water and a crate of tools. He left and went back to meet Zip.

"What did you see?" she asked, climbing down the tree. "A bunch of creeps dancing with torches. Looked like some sort of ritual." he answered. "Weird, I didn't expect to find a cult here. Anyways, I could see a road leading further east from up the tree. We could follow it." "Sure, let's go".

They walked east alongside the road, a few meters away from it. The road ended at an old abandoned gravel mine. "Dead end, let's find another way" said Tarte. They went back and followed a different road, this time going north. "Footprints! Lots of them" he said. They kept walking and soon reached the outskirts of a village. The sun had set and It was now dark outside. Lights illuminated the streets nearby. 

"Should we go in? Or around it?" asked Zip. "Something tells me that the lab is not in here, it looks too residential. But maybe some of these people work at the lab. It can't be far". "We could observe for a while, or maybe search some cars for clues" said Zip. 

They stalked around the city for a while observing the comings and goings, when suddenly they noticed a Jeep painted with a camo pattern rushing in and parking in a cul-de-sac next to a large concrete house. A woman with a white lab coat got out from the passenger's seat. The driver asked "you sure you are not coming to the bar tonight? It's game night!". The woman in the lab coat answered: "my head is spinning from work, I got to go to bed. See ya same time tomorrow morning" then she walked into the house and disappeared.

The driver turned around the cul-the-sac and for a moment the headlights flashed by Zip and Tarte, who were hidden in the bushes. "Huh?" the driver grunted, pumping the breaks. He had noticed something. He picked up a flashlight and pointed in their direction "anyone there?". He walked closer and investigated, but could not spot them again. "Must be my imagination" he said and went on his way, disappearing in the night.

"That was close" said Tarte. "Yeah. Hey, we know at least where one scientist is staying. That was not our target, but I'm sure she knows where we can find him". Tarte nodded "let's have a talk". 

They approached the concrete house. "Leave it to me" Zip said, as she climbed the side of the building like a cat, jumping from window sill to column, to the roof. She peeked for a moment and saw there was a guard up there, smoking alone in a patio. She swiftly and stealthfully got up on to the roof and crawled behind he guard. She choked him unconscious.

She entered the house from a door on the patio and walked down a flight of stairs holding her handgun. She found a few empty rooms, and heard noises in a kitchen downstairs by the main floor. In one of the rooms she found many notes by a desk. They were clearly the scientist's notes. From a glance she noticed the words "EXTRA-TERRESTRIAL CONTACT CONFIRMED" highlighted in one of the pages. Zip's eyes widened. "Holy crap, aliens!" she whispered to herself, taking the notes. 

She walked down to the main floor. She could hear the scientist in the kitchen. Zip unlocked the front door, opened it and hooted quietly like an owl. Tarte sprung out of the shadows and walked inside. They snuck towards the kitchen together, but Tarte bumped on a table on the way and a knife fell to the ground, making a loud clank. "Kiran, you there? " they heard the scientist ask. "Dammit Tarte" Zip whispered. 

She stopped at the door to the kitchen and pointed her gun towards the scientist, who was sitting at a table eating a rice dish. There was a handgun on the table close to her. As she saw Zip, she instinctively reached for her gun. "Freeze!" Zip exclaimed. The scientist faltered, then slowly pulled her hand away from it.

The scientist was a female with bleached hair and a red turtleneck. She put her hands up: "I'm doctor Sarah Hunter, I don't want any trouble. How can I help you?". Tarte entered the room and said "what do you do at the lab, and why do you work there?".

"I am a xenobiologist, I study and theorize on alien life forms. I came here because I heard of an unique opportunity to put my skills to good use at the lab. As you might imagine such an offer does not come by often in my field."

Zip held up the papers that she had found upstairs "aliens! Have you actually seen one?". "Unfortunately my work is mostly theoretical" she responded, looking away.

"How do you get in the lab? Do you have a key or an access card?" asked Tarte. "None of us scientists carry access cards, only the soldiers who drive us around are allowed to use them" she responded.

At that moment a soldier walked in to the house. "Drop your weapon!" he shouted to Zip. Zip turned around and pointed her gun towards the soldier. Dr. Sarah took the opportunity to take the gun and run. Tarte tried to stop her but he was not quick enough. "Bang!" she fired the handgun and the bullet grazed Tarte's shoulder.

With that, the soldier at the door started shooting. Another soldier walked in behind him.
Zip was hit on the chest, but she shot the soldier back in the head.

Tarte cut the doctor's hand and arm pretty badly with his large knife and she immediately dropped the gun and fell unconscious. "Over here! Intruders!" they could hear the guard shouting. "Let's bail through here, quick!" Tarte opened a kitchen window and jumped outside. Zip rolled and jumped right behind him.

They ran crouching through bushes and behind buildings. They could hear soldiers running and see beams of flashlights scanning the area around them. After a couple of minutes they were able to disappear into the swamp and leave their pursuers behind.

"That was a mess" said Zip. "Yeah, no kidding. Hold still, let me see your wound". Tarte grabbed a few medicinal plants he could find on the trail and healed her as best as he could "the bullet went through, but it did not hit any organs. The plants should numb the pain and help prevent an infection" he said. "Thanks Tarte, I do feel better" she smiled.

They pressed on towards the northeast. They found an outpost with two guards, and walked around it trying not to arise any suspicions. After a while they got to another dead end. The road ended at a lake. "We walked too far, maybe the lab was towards the west at that fork on the road" Tarte said.

They traced back their steps and took the road Tarte had referred to. After a few minutes they got to a large rock monolith with a smooth surface. A stray dog walked towards them and sniffed their boots. Zip looked closely at the monolith "What the heck? This is so strange, and it definitely makes me feel like we are getting closer to aliens! If there are any to be found..." she jested.

They walked a bit further and encountered a large factory building. They could hear the sound of machines buzzing inside. They also noticed fresh footprints going around the building. "A patrol" mentioned Zip.

Further down the road they could see another factory building, and a few guards wearing a different uniform with a red camouflaged pattern. "[[Bloody Sunrise Squad]], I bet they are the ones that carry the access keys" said Tarte. "Yeah and watch out" she pointed to a metal object on the ground "land mines". Tarte deactivated one of the mines and put it in his backpack.

 The road further down was flooded and filled with alligators. They stopped to catch a breath. "I have the feeling that the lab is hidden under one of those factories. Probably the one guarded by the Bloody Sunrise" said Zip. "That is a good guess, we should investigate".
