They walked to the back of the building and found a window that was semi-opened on the second floor.

Zip uses her grapple gun, attaching it to the wall above the window, then holds onto Tarte, and they both climb up towards the window. 

They make their way inside, but as Zip detaches her grapple gun from the wall and jumps inside, a patrol outside the building spots her.

They look around for any signs or a way to the lab. But they only see machines and factory parts. There is no-one inside and it is completely dark. They hear noises downstairs and see the beam of a flashlight.

"They are onto us. Let's set up a trap." said Zip. She climbed up the wall and stuck herself in a corner, waiting for the soldiers to pass underneath, as she did that she dropped her grappling gun. Tarte hid behind a barrel.

A guard walks by the grappling gun on the floor and says "huh, strange". He keeps going, investigating each corner, but does not look up. As he gets close to where Tarte was hiding, Zip fires at him from the ceiling.

The guard gets shot and turns around. Tarte jumps out of the barrel and tries to cut the guard, but misses in the dark. The guard fires amilessly at Tarte but misses. Zip finishes him off with another shot.

Ok, we are clear. Zip climbs down the wall. She notices her grappling gun has broken from the fall.
Tarte picks up the gun and flashlight from the guard. 
They press on downstairs.

They first floor has a production line filled with machines and conveyor belts and metal pieces.

Tarte notices a dust trail in a corner that leads to a rusty metal wall. He determines the wall is hollow and there must be a hidden passage on the other side, as it is not an exterior facing wall. He finds a hidden panel with a numpad for a pass sequence.

Tarte analyzes the numbers closely with the flashlight and determines the keys that are pressed most often. He knows which keys are in the password but not the order.

Tarte guesses the combination. Beep! Incorrect.
Tarte guesses a second time. Boop! Correct! The wall slides open, revealing a stairwell going down underground.
