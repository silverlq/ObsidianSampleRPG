A black chopper soared over the Ethiopian jungle, quickly moving east towards the wetlands. Tarte looked at the trees outside through the open door.

Zip looked annoyed  "will you close that? The draft put out my cig". "The jungle looks so green here. I've never been this far south" Tarte said as he closed the sliding door and sat down. "So what did the kid say again? His lab is doing some dangerous experiments on the fabric of reality that are likely to spiral out of control... Did he mention their objective?".

Zip lit another cigarette and replied "nah, but no doubt they are trying to gain power to strengthen their claim as an independent nation. The [[Delred Republic]] insurgents have been getting crazier every year".

Tarte analyzed Zip's body language. She seemed to know more than she was saying. "have you been there before?" he asked. "me? No, but I know a few people who fled from there".

 The pilot interrupted them: "hey lovebirds, we are approaching the target. Bad news, the fog is thick over this swamp. We will have to drop you further away than planned. Landing in T minus 5".

Zip kicked the seat in front of her: "lovebirds? Who hired this guy?". "So, it will be a bit of a trek to the village. This should be fun" said Tarte, as he tightened the laces of his boots.

Colonel Ferris entered the communication channel: "Remember operatives, we haven't heard from our contact Elias Hagos in three weeks, your mission objectives are to rescue him from the secret lab and to destroy the machine that he was working on. Godspeed and return safely".

The helicopter lowered slowly over a grassy clearing. Zip opened the sliding door and jumped out first. Tarte waited until the chopper was a bit closer to the ground and followed her. "Good luck, you two!" said the pilot, as he quickly lifted the helicopter and disappeared into the low clouds above.

Zip waved and looked at Tarte: "The village is further east. You got the big knife so why don't you lead the way and please get this tall grass out of my face".
