# Duty and death
Caranthir was a young elf who lived in [[Pinerock]] village - a small gathering of elves who lived on the treetops of southern Neverwinter Wood. He learned how to be a scout and a watcher from his father, [[Duranthir]]. 

Caranthir was tasked to travel north to the neighboring village of [[Findell]], and then to escort [[Tarkirin]], a regional shaman elder, back to [[Pinerock]]. The shaman of the elves was a matriarch who often travelled village to village to perform sacred rituals and blessings at least once every season.

When Caranthir and his father were getting ready to leave, the village of [[Pinerock]] was suddenly attacked by a large group of undead creatures - wolves, bears, foxes and other animals with putrid skin and bones showing.

A horn from a watcher blasted an alarm to warn the village of the invasion. Caranthir and his father felled some of the undead by firing arrows up from a watch tower. Duranthir saved one of the elves who was being pursued by an undead wolf. A wolverine climbed up on the watchtower, but Caranthir was able to kill it using his long knife.

After a few minutes the elven warriors of [[Pinerock]], including Caranthir and Duranthir, were able to drive the undead back. Most of them were defeated and the rest simply ceased to move, falling down to the ground lifeless.

At least twelve elves were either dead or went missing during this undead attack. [[Zorturiel]], a renowned elven warrior of [[Pinerock]] was enraged by this, and rallied many elves to gather forces and retaliate against the necromancer of the woods known as the Red Witch [[Elleren]].

Duranthir said: "Son, you must travel north and bring news of this attack to [[Tarkirin]]. I will not be able to join you in this journey as I must go with [[Zorturiel]] and the others".

Perplexed, Caranthir asked: "Is it true that the necromancer did this? I thought that she was one of us... If this is true then I should go with you!".

Duranthir ordered: "No son, you will do as I say. It is your duty to warn the shaman. Pinerock must honor the sacred tradition and report to the elder".

Reluctantly, the young elf agreed to his assignment although he was eager to find out more about this Red Witch and worried for his father.

Caranthir's mother Lauriel gave him supplies and prayed for his son's safety during the journey.

Accompanied by six others, Caranthir carried the banner of pinerock northbound into the woods, towards the village of [[Findell]]. 

# Shaman's call
During the one day trip to [[Findell]], the elves discussed the attack on [[Pinerock]].

"We must hurry and spread the news to [[Findell]]. I fear that we may need reinforcements to deal with this witch" said the leader of the group.

"They won't help us. They are afraid of this witch and they blame us for her necromancy. She was one of us after all" whispered another.

"Do not say such things! The witch is elven no longer. She has left us long ago and has become a ... creature. The people of [[Findell]] are our cousins and friends. They will heed our call." said the leader.

The cold wind shook the canopies of the trees and dark clouds covered the forest.

"An ill omen. The witch is on the move" shuddered another.

At dusk the group arrived at the outskirts of Findell. A steep cut in the terrain covered by evergreen trees revealed a twisted valley below that housed the elven village. Scouts from Findell greeted the company:

"Hail, brothers. We have been waiting for you. The weather signals trouble, or so the shaman says. Do you bear news from the south?"

"We have much to discuss, we must see [[Tarkirin]] at once" nodded the leader.

Caranthir and three others entered a great wooden shrine carved into the body of a giant oak tree. Curtains obscured the environment, dimly lit by candles and filled with a strong smell of honey and herbs.

The elder, an old elven matriarch wearing a necklace made of antlers and a dark robe, divined into a pool of black water with stones and leaves. She muttered: "The southern winds howl a cold cry of death. Lightning will color the sky with purple and ... red. The witch has returned!" as she opened her eyes wide towards Caranthir and shouted "Is this true? What have you done?".

Frozen and in shock, Caranthir did not know what to say. But before he had a chance to respond, the leader of the [[Pinerock]] group bowed and answered: "Wise Tarkirin, we need your counsil. The people of Pinerock has done nothing against our code. We have never contacted [[Elleren]] ever since she was banished. But now we are in peril, she has struck first and [[Zorturiel]] is retaliating with others. We fear we may need help to protect our village".

The elder shook her head and answered: "Zorturiel the fool. The witch wants you to retaliate. There is nothing I can do now to protect you, no elf shall defeat this evil in the southern forest. My visions were hazy before, but now I know what must be done. You must tell every last survivor of [[Pinerock]] to abandon their homes and join us here in [[Findell]]. Only the spirit of the great Oak tree can keep the red witch away".

Caranthir felt terrified. His people were in danger. His father had followed Zorturiel into the path of the broken conifers where it was said that the witch lived. He was given a horse, named Findufer the grey, to race back to [[Pinerock]] and announce the shaman's call.

# River of ashes
Caranthir rode southwards as fast as the horse could go. However, a severe lightning storm assailed the forest as he went. When he was about halfway to [[Pinerock]] he spotted a wild fire. As he approached the village a wall of fire advanced northwards. He could not get past the flames so he had to ride east and try to circumvent them. Suddenly, a flash of lightning struck a tree nearby and it fell, crashing down close to Caranthir nearly crushing him. The horse was terrified, and Caranthir fell down as the beast bolted away from the fire.

Caranthir continued on foot, searching for a path past the flames. However, he was now in unknown territory, far to the east of Pinerock. He found an old path that seemed to go southwards so he followed it. A strange cold wind blew southwards behind his back as if it was pushing him. As he climbed atop a hill, he noticed that there were ancient stones under the moss and dirt that covered the path. It must have been the remnants of an ancient people, he thought. At the top of the hill he saw a mossy pile of blocks. The strange wind seemed to swirl around him now. He could not hear any other sounds except for the rustling of leaves dancing and spinning at his feet with the circling gusts. "A burial site?" he thought.
He walked closer. There were signs that someone had been here recently. The trail was ancient but the ground was not intact. 

On the ground one of the great blocks of stone had a small clay pot with ashes, feathers and cinnamon sticks in it. A circle of chalk around it. "Some kind of ritual? Has the witch been here?" he asked himself. He saw the name "Farestel the Keeper" inscribed on the ancient rock. "Farestel? The fallen keeper of Pinerock, one of the founders" he reminded himself of the stories he had heard about that name. "He searched for forbidden knowledge and was banished for treason. It is said that he was the witch's mentor... So this is his resting place". As he gathered his thoughts, the wind calmed down. Then, he looked westward and he saw his village in the distance, covered in smoke. "No... Mother!" he raced towards it.

As he made his way through the forest, heavy rain started to pour down and put the fires out. By the time he made it to Pinerock he only found the soaked charred remains of his village covered by clouds of smoke. He searched for his mother, but he could not find her. Their home had been completely destroyed. As he was looking, he heard a voice from behind a tree calling his name, it was one of his neighbors. He whispered: "Caranthir, this way. Follow me".

Caranthir was taken to a shelter where survivors were hiding underground. There were eleven elves in there, including small children.
"They attacked again once the storm started, Caranthir. The undead came and took us by surprise. We could not flee because the fires blocked the way. We had lost all hope". Caranthir sighed: "[[Tarkirin]] had told me that the witch planned for things to happen this way. She must have foreseen we would retaliate and leave the village undefended. But... How has she amassed such power. And what has happened to [[Zorturiel]] and the others?". The elf shook his head: "we have not heard from them".

Caranthir decided to help these elves escape north, now that the fires had subsided. All thirteen of them moved quickly through the dusty, blackened leaves and broken trees. As they were crossing the edges of the village an undead hound barked and jumped towards the group. Caranthir pulled his long knife and attacked the creature, but was not able to put it down. The hound bit his arm hard, drawing blood and making him drop the weapon. After that, two other elves assailed the creature with blows and knife cuts, destroying it. One of the elves in the group, an elder healer, treated Caranthir's wound, but warned him: "Your arm is strong. It should have been broken, but instead it remains whole. However, this mark shall not leave your flesh. The creature's fangs spread some sort of curse beyond my healing powers".

They pressed on, and walked northwards until they had left the burnt trees behind them. At that point Caranthir thought: "From here on the path should be safe all the way to [[Findell]]. They shall go on without me. I must turn back and make sure my parents are safe". Then he glanced at his arm, wrapped in bandages "but I can't tell them I'm leaving or they will try to stop me". So Caranthir snuck out as he was the last in the line, and turned back southwards.

# Mourning in shadows
Caranthir walked back into the charred village, hoping to find others or clues of where his mother could be. As he was scanning the forest floor, he saw an elven figure limping and bracing on a tree stump. It was [[Zorturiel]], wounded and covered in ashes.

"Zorturiel! You are badly wounded!" Caranthir exclaimed as he ran towards the warrior and helped him sit down to rest. Zorturiel's chest was bleeding badly, he was in dire need of immediate medical attention.

"Caranthir... We were ambushed... It was a trap... Your father... I'm sorry" Zorturiel whispered and coughed blood. Caranthir did not have much experience with healing, but he tried to stop the bleeding by pressing a piece of cloth against the wound, then he looked around for anything that he could use to help the dying elf.

"It's no use, young one" Zorturiel whispered, and tried to smile to calm Caranthir down, holding his arm "This is my fate. Before I go I need you to listen to me". Caranthir felt a pit in his stomach, he knew he did not have the means to prevent Zorturiel from dying, but he still wanted to try regardless. Caranthir sighed: "I must take you to [[Tarkirin]], only she could treat these wounds".

"Listen!" the warrior commanded, then coughed up more blood. "The witch [[Elleren]] must have planned for this long ago. She had been quietly amassing power all these decades. And we have been blind to it. [[Tarkirin]] cannot save me just as well as she cannot protect our people".

"What are you saying? Is there no hope?" asked Caranthir, confused.

"Here" Zorturiel grunted, struggling to move his injured arm and remove a ring from his hand, handing it over "take this to Helm's Hold". It was an old ring crafted from hardened oak wood, shaped like a great tree. "They will recognize this... Tell them... about what happened". Then he winced in pain as the ring fell on the ground. Caranthir held his hand as he slowly passed away without another word.

Caranthir was left alone, kneeling next to the dead warrior, lost in his thoughts. "Is father... dead? And... Helm's Hold?" he thought, "why would humans aid us? Even if...". Then he paused, remembering what the shaman had said: "no elf shall defeat this evil... so does that mean that seeking a human alliance could be the answer?". He shook his head, remembering his mother "I need to find her".

Caranthir looked in the weaver's workshop where Lauriel worked. He found seven survivors taking shelter there but not his mother. "It should be safe to get out now, we must leave to [[Findell]]" he reached for one of them, "I will check the temple of Rillifane for more survivors". Some of [[Tarkirin]]'s elves arrived from [[Findell]] and helped Caranthir gather all the remaining elves in the scorched ruins of [[Pinerock]], then led them north to find refuge in [[Findell]]. Caranthir muttered, looking eastwards: "I can't find [[Lauriel]]. I can't leave without doing something about this. I think she might have taken the path of broken conifers to look for father".

A tall elf by the name of Elronel ordered: "It is time to go Caranthir. [[Tarkirin]]'s orders are to leave this place, especially that way which you talk about. No elf that has walked towards the witch has survived". Caranthir protested: "I cannot leave without her. She might still be alive". As Caranthir left the group, Elronel warned: "do not seek the witch! It would be madness to do so now. Everyone who has done so has disappeared. Is that what you want your fate to be?".

Caranthir stood by the entrance to the path of broken conifers. Crows cawed in the woods around it. The young elf thought "If I go in there I am doomed. But my mother...". Then he felt something in his pocket, and pulled out the wooden ring [[Zorturiel]] gave him. "Helm's Hold is the only way."

# Dawn of hope
As he was travelling west to Helm's Hold, he found Findufer, the grey horse he had lost earlier that day that was given to him in [[Findell]]. "So there you are, friend" Caranthir smiled, as the beast approached slowly and greeted the elf lowering it's head. On horse back, having regained some confidence, he was able to travel through the forest and reach his destination the next morning.

The walled citadel of Helm's Hold stood before him. It was the first time Caranthir had left the forests to the east, and he did not have much experience with humans. He thought that they were proud and selfish, often greedy. He would have never come here to ask them for aid if not for [[Zorturiel]]'s dying wish. He approached the city gates slowly. Guards greeted him and acknowledged Zorturiel's ring. "a wood elf from [[Pinerock]], let him in" said one of the guards, as another took him in and brought him to the city's warden, a man named Jenus Fireveil.

After telling his story to the warden in a room with all the chief enforcers and defenders of the fortress, they asked Caranthir to leave the room briefly while the humans discussed what to do: "My condolences, dear elf. Zorturiel was a trusted ally and friend of mine, we are sad to hear about your grave losses. Please wait outside now while we discuss what to do". 

After a few moments, Jenus opened the door followed by other guards and spoke to the elf: "The Order of the Guilded Eye has decided to aid your people at once. It is our sacred duty to eradicate unnatural beings such as this undead menace. Will you show us the way through the forest?". Caranthir felt hope and sighed: "Yes, of course! Thank you!". He thought he had misjudged humans, some of them could be honorable after all.

After a short rest, Caranthir left the citadel with the cavalry of the Guilded Eye that afternoon. Dozens of knights carrying large shields, longswords and maces, filed eastward. Caranthir was feeling very tired, but the adrenaline of the quick turn of events kept him going. 

They traveled for a day, stopping to rest a few hours away from the ruins of [[Pinerock]]. Caranthir was feeling exhausted but was too anxious to have a good rest. The thought of losing his parents was too painful for him to bear. They set out early the next day, before the sun rose on the east. At noon they had finally entered the witch's domain.

It was a trail of ancient stones, cracked and lost within mud and moss, surrounded by ominous black trees, bare and twisted. Some of the knights still carried torches even after sunrise, whispering prayers to their god and guardian, Helm. They followed the trail up to a valley where they could see a sharp cliff on the far side, where the dark rock was sharp and jagged. "Where to next?" asked the cavalry's captain.  Caranthir shrugged "I have never been to this part of the woods before. It is said that the witch lives in this valley, but I am not sure where". The captain responded "The undead despise the sunlight, we should look for shelters and holes where they could be hiding. You have done your part elf. Stay back here with the rear guard. My men will take it from here".

After about four hours Caranthir heard sounds of distant screaming and fighting. One of the knights of the Guilded Eye made his way back from the rock wall on the other side of the valley and greeted the others "we have found the witch's lair. I believe we have the situation under control, but you should join us just in case". The rear guard, along with Caranthir, made their way through the valley and into a cavern at the bottom of the black rock cliff. Piles of bones and stakes littered the ground at the entrance. A faint smell of decay was in the air.

The fighting had ended by the time that the rear guard got the cavern. One of the knights was branding the decapitated head of the witch while others cheered: "Helm! Helm! Helm!". The captain approached Caranthir: "We have found prisoners, follow me". Caranthir was led to a dungeon where captives were being kept. The knights were liberating them, breaking down the doors. Among the prisoners there was [[Lauriel]], Caranthir's mother. She raced towards her son when she saw him, and gave him a tight embrace.

"Mother! I thought I had lost you!" Caranthir exclaimed, filled with joy "What about father, have you seen him?". Lauriel saddened and shook her head "I came looking for him, but I could not find him". They spent another two hours searching the dungeon and caverns but could not find [[Duranthir]]. Lauriel paused to rest, and fell asleep while sitting on a rock. "Mother, you are too tired to continue searching" said Caranthir. At that moment he noticed black marks on her arms creeping from under her sleeves. She had been cursed by the witch. Many of the captives turned out to have the same marks.

"Those are ritual engravings" said a cleric of Helm that was standing nearby, "she will need to be taken to Helm's Hold for proper cleansing". Caranthir swallowed and nodded. The knights escorted the elves out of the caverns and back into [[Pinerock]] before sunset. Many elves set out north to [[Findell]] but Caranthir, along with all the ones that had been marked by the witch were taken west to be cleansed at the Cathedral of Helm.

# Forging the future
Caranthir and his mother Lauriel, along with twelve other elvish survivors, stayed in Helm's Hold for about two months until the priests could study and cleanse the curse that had been etched onto their flesh. While the elves were being treated, Caranthir thought about his father and planned on going back to the woods to search for him. However, when he was reviewing the items that were retrieved by the knights from the dungeon he found his father's old bow. He pressed the bow against his forehead and cried, accepting that his father must have not survived. "He died fighting to save us" Caranthir thought, "I must live up to such selfless bravery myself".

After the priests were done cleansing the wounded, all twelve other elves decided to travel back northeast to [[Findell]]. Lauriel would have left with them, but Caranthir insisted on staying since he wanted to pledge his service to the Order and learn the ways of a paladin. The Order accepted his request. Lauriel decided to stay with his son in Helm's Hold and offer her services as a weaver to the local community.

Four years passed. During this period Caranthir served the order mostly working in the stables and was now offered to join the ranks as a squire. He then learned the ways of the Order of the Guilded Eye, attended lectures on the history of the realms and of the guardian god, Helm. After three years serving as a squire he met a travelling paladin named [[Bregor]], the silver, who had come to Helm's Hold to turn in a wanted sorcerer. Bregor did not worship Helm. Instead, he was a paladin of the Triad, a trinity of gods formed by Torm, Tyr and Ilmater. Caranthir was tasked to act as Bregor's shield bearer during the week that he was visiting.

From Bregor, Caranthir learned about the lost Order of the Triadic Knights, originally from the distant kingdom of Impiltur. Caranthir was captivated by Bregor's virtue and passion. Triadic knights were balanced, he thought, as they were compelled to pursue evil by Torm, to judge fairly by Tyr, and to show compassion and aid by Ilmater. The knights of Helm, by contrast, were more strict in their ways, with the law and order being their paramount commandment. Caranthir was forever grateful to them for having liberated his people, but noted over time that they could be occasionally overly bureaucratic and unyielding.

The day before Bregor was set to leave, they met at a shrine dedicated to Tyr, located close to Helm's Cathedral. Soft rays of sunlight pierced the clouds above on that summer day. Caranthir was waiting by a birch tree when Bregor left the temple. "A fine day to say our farewells" approached Bregor, "you have been a fine squire. What does the future hold for you, Caranthir?" he asked with a smile. Caranthir bowed "Sir Bregor, seven years ago I decided to stay at Helm's Hold to learn the ways of the knights of Helm. I wish to become a paladin sir". Bregor nodded, keeping the smile: "I see strength and determination in you, my friend. No, more than that. You have natural talent and bravery, well suited for a paladin". Then he paused, looked at the leaves rustling with the wind with a more serious expression and continued "tomorrow I set out on a four day's journey to The Crags to the north. There are rumors of confusion and evil-doing there. I could use some help". Caranthir spoke "Sir, it has been an honor to serve you here at the Hold. Thank you for sharing your wisdom with me. If you require my assistance, it would be my greatest honor to accompany you in a journey".

Later that day, the Hold's warden spoke with Caranthir, and asked if he would like to remain there and join the ranks of the knights of the Guilded Eye, or be dismissed and join Bregor in his quest. Caranthir felt that it was his destiny to travel the lands and help others in need alongside Bregor, so he made his decision. The two of them left the next morning. From that day on Caranthir and Bregor became apprentice and master.

Caranthir followed Bregor in various adventures for about five years, and learned the ways of the Triadic Knights. He became a paladin of the Triad, and devout to all three gods: Torm, Tyr and Ilmater. Their home base was a temple of Tyr in the city of Neverwinter. Lauriel also moved to the same city and opened a shop, specializing in capes and dresses.
