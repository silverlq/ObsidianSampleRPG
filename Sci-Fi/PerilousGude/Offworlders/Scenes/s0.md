I am [[Varis Basard]], a mercenary who is earning some coin from the [[Liberation Army]] to bring pain upon the [[Atlatech Conglomerate]]. I have been on the move for a couple of years, ever since I left prison and lost my career as a mechanic at Atlatech. I had been deceived by propaganda that the Millians were horrible monsters and that the Conglomerate was bringing peace and prosperity to the systems at the fringe of civilization. I now know the truth that Millians are peaceful creatures, being driven away from their home-worlds by the greed of Atlatech. I was even put in jail for trying to expose the truth.

[[Zalta Hinza]], a good pilot and a friend has joined me in a quest to place spy micro-satellites and monitoring devices on an Atlatech outpost in the Steltos System. Our ship [[Icarus Aegis]] had been purchased at a suspiciously cheap price, but I didn't make much of it at the time.

When we made the jump into the [[PG 0606 Description|Steltos System]] (subsector 0606) our ship malfunctioned, we overshot and ended up inside of the ion beacon next to the Steltos red star.
