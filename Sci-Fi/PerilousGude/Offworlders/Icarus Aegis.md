## Upgrades
- **Shuttle Hangar**:  Comes with a small shuttle which can fly independently, but cannot travel between stars on its own
- **Advanced Electronics**: High-end scanners, communicators, sensors, etc. They will provide detailed information about ships, places, and stations you encounter

## Maintenance 
- At a suitable spaceport, Hull damage can be repaired at a cost of 1 credit per 2 points of Hull. Damage to specific systems or critical areas of the ship may cost much more, at the GMâ€™s discretion.
- Drive fuel costs 3 credits per unit, and is available in any reasonably equipped port.
